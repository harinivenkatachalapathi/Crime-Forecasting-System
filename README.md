## Key Responsibilities

### Data Integration
- Aggregated and managed datasets from diverse sources, including historical crime records, demographic data, and environmental conditions using SQL and MongoDB.

### Spatial Analysis
- Applied DBSCAN clustering to identify crime hotspots and filter out noise.
- Visualized clustering results using Folium maps.

### Temporal Forecasting
- Utilized ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models for time series analysis to predict crime trends.
- Achieved ~90% accuracy in forecasting 30-day incident patterns.

### Visualization
- Designed interactive maps with Leaflet.js to showcase real-time and forecasted crime data for actionable insights.

### Performance Metrics
- Evaluated models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for predictive accuracy.
- Used precision and recall metrics for clustering validation.
